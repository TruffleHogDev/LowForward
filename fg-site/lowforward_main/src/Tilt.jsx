        <h1>It's OK to Lose- A Healthy Approach to Tilting Situations</h1>

        <p>It's important to reiterate that you can and will still lose to "random" playstyles, even when you're practiced. You'll still lose to players that you might consider to be "worse", 
        and that's fine. It's just the way it goes. Processing losses, tilt, and overcoming mental barriers in a healthy way is an important life skill in general, and it can be especially 
        difficult in fighting games where you have nothing but yourself to blame for your shortcomings. This article will outline ways to grow from losses, deal with tilt, and talk about 
        one of my own personal barriers to hopefully give some perspective on growth as a player.</p>
