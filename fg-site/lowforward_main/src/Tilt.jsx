        <h1>It's OK to Lose- A Healthy Approach to Tilting Situations</h1>

        <p>As has been said many times across this site, it's important to have a growth-oriented approach to losses- to take them each as a learning opportunity for whatever you're practicing.
        Focusing on progression over winrates, labbing the things that you struggle with, and then getting back out there and trying again so that it becomes easier over time. All of this is 
        great advice, but in a competitive genre like this, tilt can make these things easier said than done. Everybody has dealt with tilt at some point or another, and learning how to process 
        it and move past it is critical for both your mental health and your enjoyment of the game. Speaking from experience, many things that tilted me when I was a beginner and intermediate 
        player stemmed from me either not understanding what I was upset about, having the wrong mindset for my problem, or both. Today, I want to go over some common thoughts that 
        people have when they're tilted, as well as how to deal with them.</p>
