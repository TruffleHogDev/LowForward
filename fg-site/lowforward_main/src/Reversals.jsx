        <h1>Playing Around Reversals</h1>

        <p>If you've been following the guides so far, you'll have begun building a solid foundation with your anti-airs a 
        simple but effective strike/throw offense backed by reliable, strong combos. You might be having an easy time dealing with 
        players who have poor defense and starting to crack open tougher opponents, but you may still struggle when they have an
        invincible wakeup reversal at their disposal. When is it a good idea to respect it and when should you ignore it? Are there tells 
        for when someone might be trying to send a reversal? Is there a way to attack an opponent while staying safe to a potential
        reversal? Being attacked when you're trying to press your advantage can be intimidating, 
        and even the threat of a reversal can completely halt your offensive momentum. Understanding how reversals work is the first 
        part of understanding how to play around them, and in this article we're going to cover the different types of invincible 
        reversals, their strengths and weaknesses, ways to mitigate the risk and play around them, and then go into a bit of theory that 
        will hopefully deepen your understanding of managing risk/reward and how to quickly evaluate a position.
