            <h3>
              This website is designed to help people of all skill levels better
              understand fighting game theory. When I started getting serious
              about fighting games, I was extremely frustrated by how hard it
              was to find good, straightforward answers to questions like "How
              do I poke?" or "How do I go for throws if they keep hitting me?"
            </h3>

            <h3>
              I want to help smoothen the learning curve when it comes to
              understanding fighting games on a deeper level by teaching you how
              to answer those kinds of questions. Your support helps me make
              LowForward the best community resource it can possibly be.
            </h3>
