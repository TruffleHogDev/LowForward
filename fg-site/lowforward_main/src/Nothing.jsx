            <h1>Satsui no Hado: The Power of (doing) Nothing</h1>

            <p>If you've been following the guides to this point, you should now have AAs, combos and confirms, and a basic understanding of 
            offensive and defensive fundamentals- all necessary tools to better navigate the neutral game. This article will be focused on 
            describing what commitment means in the context of the neutral game, how and why low commitment neutral works, and my approach 
            to it.</p>

            <p>It's very important to note that playing low commitment does not necessarily mean playing passively. You can still position
            yourself aggressively and actively engage with your opponent, you're simply doing so in a risk-averse way that makes you difficult
            to challenge.</p>

            <h3>Commitment in fighting games</h3>

            <hr className="smallDivider" />

            <p>Any time you take an action in a fighting game, you can think of it as committing to that action, in the sense that you are
            locked in to it until its recovery frames end. By extension, you are also open to attack for that action's duration.
            Choosing actions that are lower commitment- such as walking, blocking, or using pokes with fast startup and low recovery- 
            limits the number of potential openings you give your opponent. It also makes contesting you midscreen more difficult because 
            you can potentially respond to anything your opponent does, and the implied threat that you could attack at any time can 
            make more patient opponents hesitant to hold their ground and back away from you.</p>

            <p>On the flipside, not committing to bigger buttons can also empower your opponents to do something risky and press their 
            big buttons or commit to things like jumps, dashes, etc. Being able to use our anti-airs, punish confirms, parries, etc to 
            shut down those options when they do happen are absolutely essential to maintain your position and increase pressure 
            on your opponent. Remember, you're not always playing low commitment to be passive unless it benefits you- typically this is 
            if you have a life lead and a good screen position since you have no incentive to approach, or you're in burnout and can 
            afford to block until the duration ends. </p>

            <p>Low commitment neutral works best as a baseline when you can use your basic movement and blocks to get an idea for how 
            your opponent plays, when and how they like to press buttons, and safely put yourself in a favourable position for when you 
            want to engage. You cannot always play non-committally, as some matchups and screen positions can force you to constantly make 
            committal decisions in order to get in- while this exists in SF6 to some extent, especially when closing in on zoners with low 
            drive, this is much more prevalent in anime fighters like GGST, for example, where dashblock IBs 
            or alternative mobility tools are all but mandatory at high levels to close in on characters with strong mid and long-range screen
            control. It's an incredibly strong style to use in a few situations: when you're not sure of the opponent's habits and want to 
            gather information, when your opponent is constantly going all in, and when your opponent is patient and playing non-committally 
            themselves.</p>

            <h3>Musings on low commitment neutral</h3>

            <hr className="smallDivider" />

            <p>Weaker opponents will generally lose outright to someone who does not constantly present big openings to punish, since they 
            don't understand how to approach someone who isn't willing to go all in on every interaction. Defeating this kind of player with 
            a low commitment style does take a lot of practice and can be difficult to do because it's inherently reactive; being able to 
            consistently check their movement, anti-air them, defending and punishing their all ins, etc, can overload your mental stack and 
            make you too passive if you aren't ready. It's impossible to always be ready for everything, but you can be looking for one or 
            two things they have shown they like to do and be ready for those, but have a defensive catch-all against other options. For 
            example, if your opponent is a Cammy who likes to poke with 2MK drive rushes and varying air mixups with jumps, divekicks, 
            and hooligans, you can play around the max range of their 2MK and look for anti-airs and openings to poke them, either block or 
            delay tech when they drive rush 2MK and allow them to burn themselves out,
            but then use parries as a blanket check to defend against options like DI or spin knuckle. If they start dashing up to you, then 
            you can adapt by mashing with your 4-frame to check them and hit confirming it. This makes scouting your opponent's habits much more 
            manageable, since you only need 2 or 3 things to respond to everything they're doing instead of potentially 5 or more. </p>

            <p>Even at higher levels of play, many people have fairly linear attacking and defending flowcharts that you can figure out with 
            patience- being able to do this is a skill that must be practiced, and consistency comes with a lot of experience and failure. A 
            lot of it honestly comes down to pattern recognition. If you don't want to risk attacking someone unpredictable, switch up your 
            tactics from running your regular strike/throw and focus on winning neutral, where you are more comfortable and they have an 
            exploitable blind spot. If you don't know how to defend against a hyper aggressive attacker, especially one that has a good sense of 
            when to bait reversals, block it out and be willing to take a few throws until you can make an educated guess as to what they will 
            choose. One way to think of it is like you're getting X number of guesses to escape, where X is the number of throws they 
            need to KO you, or you can gamble and lose in 2-3 hits from full health if you're wrong. You won't always win against 
            volatile players like that even when you're experienced, and that's okay. There's always a takeaway or adaptation that could 
            have been made, or worst case you have something concrete to lab an answer to if you were getting knowledge checked. Remember 
            that hyper aggressive playstyles are especially popular in ranked because they are effective at getting quick wins in short sets 
            and are hard to stop without practice, but this style of patient play will completely stonewall the overwhelming majority of the 
            playerbase because it is simply a side of the game they rarely have to engage with. Top level players can play either way, and 
            constantly rotate their options or make very slight adjustments to their moves and timings to make themselves unpredictable. 
            It's important to remember to not over rely on one specific approach to neutral as you become a more well-rounded player, 
            especially when you come across strong opponents who do adapt quickly.</p>

            <h3>What low commitment neutral looks like</h3>

            <hr className="smallDivider" />

            <p>In the following video example, you can see low commitment neutral in action against a local Kim. I had a lot of respect for 
            their offense and ability to snowball an advantage, so I took extra care to play slowly and focus on gaining ground and 
            watching to see what they did when I attacked sparsely. The close-range fireballs were thrown when I was reasonably sure there 
            would be either pokes to counterpoke or forward movement- if you are in a similar situation and don't have a fireball, you can use a larger 
            whiff punish button, such as Jamie's 5HK, or attempt to check them with something like a 5MK or 2MK. 
            The longer range hados were to test willingness to reaction teleport and slide that round. 
            Since we were playing at my pace, my strings weren't being perfect parried or otherwise punished, and I was winning in neutral, 
            I was for the most part okay to not risk eating a wakeup level 3 and keep up the pressure midscreen. I did sneak in some 
            throws near the end once it had been clearly established that we were both respecting each others' wakeup, 
            just to avoid being too linear. The 2HP was actually straight up a misinput 5HP, whoops.
            </p>

            <figcaption>Example of a round won primarily through low commitment neutral. Pay special attention to how I approach and hold 
            space.
            Even though there are a few mistakes and missed punishes, I get enough openings from watching their habits over the course of the 
            round to comfortably close things out.

            <hr className="smallDivider" />

            <p>In summary, low commitment neutral is a strong baseline approach for figuring out your opponent's habits, countering 
            stereotypical online playstyles, and dictating the pace of a match. It takes a lot of practice and a strong understanding 
            of what your options are on offence and defence to pull off consistently, but it is one of the most reliable ways to beat 
            opponents of all skill levels. You don't have to react to everything, punish everything, or play perfectly all the time, and it's unrealistic to expect that will happen; 
            the entire point of this style is to make it hard for them to get a clean hit on you even if you do screw up. To be honest, I wasn't even particularly happy with how I played the set- 
            I didn't even want to play the game and was kind of in a slump, and all my replays were deleted, but I feel showing games with several mistakes can also illustrate just how consistent 
            playing like this can be against strong opponents. As an aside, Chains is a great Guilty Gear player as well. Shoutout to the FGCC.</p>
