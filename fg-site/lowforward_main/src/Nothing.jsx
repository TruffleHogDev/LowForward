          <h1>Satsui no Hado: The Power of (doing) Nothing</h1>

          <p>
            If you've been following the guides to this point, you should now
            have an understanding of AAs, combos and confirms, and a basic
            understanding of offensive and defensive fundamentals- all necessary
            tools to better navigate the neutral game. This article will be
            focused on explaining how and why low commitment neutral works, and
            my approach to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's very important to note that playing low commitment does not
            mean playing passively. Being overly passive is something I would
            consider to be a weakness at high levels of play, because it's
            important to control your opponent's movement and make it as hard as
            possible for them to do the things they want. You can still position
            yourself aggressively and actively engage with your opponent, you're
            simply doing so in a risk-averse way that makes you difficult to
            challenge, and intelligently choosing your moments to commit to
            bigger moves.

          <h3>Commitment in fighting games</h3>

          <hr className="smallDivider" />

          <p>
            Any time you take an action in a fighting game, you can think of it
            as committing to that action, in the sense that you are locked in to
            it until its recovery frames end. By extension, you are also open to
            attack for that action's duration. Choosing actions that are lower
            commitment- such as walking, blocking, or using pokes with fast
            startup and low recovery- limits the number of potential openings
            you give your opponent. It also makes contesting you midscreen more
            difficult because you can potentially respond to anything your
            opponent does, and the implied threat that you could attack at any
            time can make more patient opponents hesitant to hold their ground
            and back away from you.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the flipside, not committing to bigger buttons can also empower
            your opponents to do something risky and press their big buttons or
            commit to things like jumps, dashes, etc. Being able to use our
            anti-airs, punish confirms, parries, etc to shut down those options
            when they do happen are absolutely essential to maintain your
            position and increase pressure on your opponent. Remember, you're
            not always playing low commitment to be passive unless it benefits
            you- typically this is if you have a life lead and a good screen
            position since you have no incentive to approach, or you're in
            burnout and can afford to block until the duration ends.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            Low commitment neutral works best as a baseline when you can use
            your basic movement and blocks to get an idea for how your opponent
            plays, when and how they like to press buttons, and safely put
            yourself in a favourable position for when you want to engage. You
            cannot always play non-committally, as some matchups and screen
            positions can force you to constantly make committal decisions in
            order to win- while this exists in SF6 to some extent, especially
            when closing in on zoners with low drive, this is much more
            prevalent in anime fighters like GGST, for example, where dashblock
            IBs or alternative mobility tools are all but mandatory at high
            levels to close in on characters with strong mid and long-range
            screen control. It's an incredibly strong style to use in a few
            situations: when you're not sure of the opponent's habits and want
            to gather information, when your opponent is constantly going all
            in, and when your opponent is patient and playing non-committally
            themselves.

          <h3>Musings on low commitment neutral</h3>

          <hr className="smallDivider" />

          <p>
            Weaker opponents will generally lose outright to someone who does
            not constantly present big openings to punish, since they don't
            understand how to approach someone who isn't willing to go all in on
            every interaction. Defeating this kind of player with a low
            commitment style does take a lot of practice and can be difficult to
            do because it's inherently reactive; being able to consistently
            check their movement, anti-air them, defending and punishing their
            all ins, etc, can overload your mental stack and make you too
            passive if you aren't ready. It's impossible to always be ready for
            everything, but you can be looking for one or two things they have
            shown they like to do and be ready for those, but have a defensive
            catch-all against other options. For example, if your opponent is a
            Cammy who likes to poke with 2MK drive rushes and varying air mixups
            with jumps, divekicks, and hooligans, you can play around the max
            range of their 2MK and look for anti-airs and openings to poke them,
            either block or delay tech when they drive rush 2MK and allow them
            to burn themselves out, but then use parries as a blanket check to
            defend against options like DI or spin knuckle. If they start
            dashing up to you, then you can adapt by mashing with your 4-frame
            to check them and hit confirming it. This makes scouting your
            opponent's habits much more manageable, since you only need 2 or 3
            things to respond to everything they're doing instead of potentially
            5 or more.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            Even at higher levels of play, many people have fairly linear
            attacking and defending flowcharts that you can figure out with
            patience- being able to do this is a skill that must be practiced,
            and consistency comes with a lot of experience and failure. A lot of
            it honestly comes down to pattern recognition. If you don't want to
            risk attacking someone unpredictable, switch up your tactics from
            running your regular strike/throw and focus on winning neutral,
            where you are more comfortable and they have an exploitable blind
            spot. If you don't know how to defend against a hyper aggressive
            attacker, especially one that has a good sense of when to bait
            reversals, block it out and be willing to take a few throws until
            you can make an educated guess as to what they will choose. One way
            to think of it is like you're getting X number of guesses to escape,
            where X is the number of throws they need to KO you, or you can
            gamble and lose in 2-3 hits from full health if you're wrong. You
            won't always win against volatile players like that even when you're
            experienced, and that's okay. There's always a takeaway or
            adaptation that could have been made, or worst case you have
            something concrete to lab an answer to if you were getting knowledge
            checked. Remember that hyper aggressive playstyles are especially
            popular in ranked because they are effective at getting quick wins
            in short sets and are hard to stop without practice, but this style
            of patient play will completely stonewall the overwhelming majority
            of the playerbase because it is simply a side of the game they
            rarely have to engage with. Top level players can play either way,
            and constantly rotate their options or make very slight adjustments
            to their moves and timings to make themselves unpredictable. It's
            important to remember to not over rely on one specific approach to
            neutral as you become a more well-rounded player, especially when
            you come across strong opponents who do adapt quickly.

          <h3>What low commitment neutral looks like</h3>

          <hr className="smallDivider" />

          <p>
            In the following video example, you can see low commitment neutral
            in action. The Dictator player was bullying me hard midrange, and
            risking RPSing around scissor kicks with moves like 5LK, 5MK, and
            2MP wasn't something I wanted to do, so instead I used fireballs to
            beat his pokes, then carried that momentum forward on offense since
            he didn't have any super meter built. With a better confirm off of
            2MK he was dead to super, but the light fireball after more or less
            forced a response from him that I could punish. If he had attempted
            OD crusher, I had time to DP. If he blocked, I had time to approach
            and repeat the midscreen situation with a huge advantage, even in
            burnout. 2MK being buffered so that DR only came out on hit made it
            completely safe to use as it was too far to be blocked, and even if
            2MK caught a DI, I had the meter to react with level 1. When I
            pressed 5HK, my intent was to do drive damage and hopefully goad him
            into whiffing scissor kicks after backing up a little. I jumped when
            I hoped he would use scissor kicks or a move I could potentially
            punish like 5HP (which is exactly what he did), since he was
            focusing on the ground and Dictator has trouble dealing with
            crossups. The string before the jinrai was actually a setup for a
            spacing trap.

          <p>
            In summary, low commitment neutral is a strong baseline approach for
            figuring out your opponent's habits, countering stereotypical online
            playstyles, and dictating the pace of a match. It takes a lot of
            practice and a strong understanding of what your options are on
            offence and defence to pull off consistently, but it is one of the
            most reliable ways to beat opponents of all skill levels. You don't
            have to react to everything, punish everything, or play perfectly
            all the time, and it's unrealistic to expect that will happen; the
            entire point of this style is to make it hard for them to get a
            clean hit on you even when you do screw up.
