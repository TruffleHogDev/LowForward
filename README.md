LowForward is my first real project, created from scratch, and designed to teach fighting game fundamentals through the lens of Street Fighter 6. 

This project has by far had the most effort put into it and I really want this to be a long-lasting community resource for years or even decades to come once I'm finally happy with it. 

It's built using Vite and Tailwind, and is an SPA website that uses hash routing to show you articles that I have written and produced all content for myself (except for the numpad notation image.)

LF is currently in the middle of yet another dramatic design overhaul- the bulk of the UI work is done, but there is still a lot to do:

1: Improve the layout and readability of the homepage and navigation pages slightly more, especially on landscape mode mobile devices- there's a bug I notice on Android where you have to scroll a little bit to get the very bottom of the page to render.

2: Articles need to be rewritten. The feedback I generally get is that the content is good, but difficult to read. The UI redesign came before the rewrites, but the articles will be rewritten with a tone more appropriate for a general reading audience, and aim to be more engaging by introducing the concept, asking a "why", then answering that why. Complementary article-specific UI improvements still need to be made, though some are partially completed. This will overall take the most amount of time.

3: Support page needs to look cleaner. It's very blocky and wordy and ugly to look at compared to the other navbar pages.

4: Homepage to have a component that suggests articles- this was planned for after the rewrites because of the significance of the changes, but will likely be implemented sooner and updated as needed.
