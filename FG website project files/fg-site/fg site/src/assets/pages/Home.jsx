   <p> This site is designed to be a text-based resource for teaching players of all skill levels the fundamentals behind forming a strong, safe, and consistent gameplan in 2D fighting games,
   predominantly focusing on Street Fighter 6. Whether you're a newcomer to fighting games and want to learn how to approach the genre with tactics that work at the highest levels of
   competition, or a master trying to push through another plateau, this site will have something for everyone.
   
   Check out the Resources tab for supplementary material, especially if you're a newcomer to fighting games.</p>
   <p>Please be aware that this website is currently a work in progress- both the code for the site and all the content are being written from scratch by one person, and upcoming articles can be found at
   the bottom of the Concepts page. I appreciate your understanding while development continues.</p>
